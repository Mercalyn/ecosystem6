DIRECTOR
[x] feeding into multigrid forward pass, get rid of two separate func calls (renamed, they make sense)
[x] change args to file config files, in /config/ named obj inside for customizeability
[/] fix logging so no need to print log, dco([channels], input_msg)# debug eco, lco([channels]) # log out channel (otherwise dont), channel consistency between functions .. add later??
[x] args to file config files: gpu config stuff

MULTIGRID
[x] shorthand
[x] new layer [] system
[x] verify output
[x] .tcdata versioning
[x] dropout
[x] add lstm functionality
[x] remove gridFeed dropout to config
[x] see if can do current @= to matmul into, yes, you can!
[x] rename tex.crate contents from w_a, b_0, etc to wt_ bs_, _0 _1 _act so it is more descriptive (getting rid of _i -> _0)
[x] rename contents again to 0_dense_wt, 0_dense_bs, act_dense_wt, act_dense_bs, 0_lstm_
[x] delete add/del hidden depth/height, might readd later if needed crucially

CONV
[x] delete (it never functioned well)

SSN
[x] fix graphing

EVO
[x] scoreTexture convert to _1d, opTourney, destMask
[x] shorthand
[/] evo destination mask enum - tensors wont accept an enum
[x] rewrite tournament efficient
[x] verify output
[x] get rid of elites permanently (except for topmost)
[x] defrost to config
[x] evostep split return statement something else for clarity
[-] rewrite all to not return but mutate

EXAMPLES / TESTS
[-] lstm test
[-] new example: parametric estimator (t) in, (x,y) out, think limacon or rose petals
[x] polecart with only 80 pop.. also test for deeper nets.. also test lstm + only position. 80 pops works but lstm only pos very moderate..
[x] polecart physics shorthand

notes:
lstm tester
